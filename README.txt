This project defines sorted and unsorted ArrayList objects as well as Deque objects
by implementing standard Java arrays. All of these objects inherit an AbstractArray
Class which contains their shaired functionality. This project is ment to be an
exercise in inheritance and class heiarchy while also providing practice to help 
better understand how ArrayLists are/can be implemented in Java.
